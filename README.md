## 📖 How to Add a New Tutorial

Adding a new tutorial takes 2 steps:

### Step 1: Create the markdown file

Create a folder under `src/content/<category>/` with a markdown file matching the tutorial id:

```
src/content/system-design/chat-system/chat-system.md
```

Write your tutorial following the **Content Authoring Guide** below.

### Step 2: Register it

Open `src/features/tutorials/tutorialRegistry.js` and add an entry:

```js
{
  id: 'chat-system',                    // must match folder name AND md filename
  title: 'Chat System',
  description: 'Design a real-time messaging system',
  category: 'System Design',
  subcategory: 'Classic Designs',
  icon: CloudQueue,                      // any MUI icon
  tags: ['HLD', 'LLD', 'WebSocket'],
},
```

If adding a new category, update `getCategoryIcon()` in the same file.

That's it. The app auto-discovers the `.md` file by matching the `id` to the folder name.

## ✍️ Content Authoring Guide — The Master Prompt

Use this as a structured prompt when creating or modifying any tutorial. This ensures every topic has consistent quality, interview readiness, and scenario-based depth.

### The Prompt

Copy and adapt this for every new tutorial or enhancement:

```
Create/Update tutorial: [TOPIC NAME]
Category: [System Design | Microservices | Java | Architecture Decisions | Real-World Builds | DSA | ...]
Subcategory: [e.g., Classic Designs, Concurrency & Parallelism, Data Layer, ...]

Follow this structure EXACTLY:

─────────────────────────────────────────────
1. TITLE & OPENING ANALOGY
─────────────────────────────────────────────
- Title format: "[Topic] — [Subtitle that tells what you'll learn]"
- Open with a real-world analogy (restaurant, library, post office, city, etc.)
- The analogy must make the concept click for someone with ZERO background
- No textbook definitions — explain like you're talking to a smart colleague

─────────────────────────────────────────────
2. CORE CONCEPTS (Scenario-Driven)
─────────────────────────────────────────────
- Teach each concept through a SCENARIO, not a definition
  Bad:  "A HashMap uses hashing to store key-value pairs"
  Good: "You do map.put('name', 'Alice') — here's what happens step by step"
- Use code examples that are REAL (e-commerce, payment, user service — not Foo/Bar)
- Show the WRONG way first (❌), then the RIGHT way (✅) with explanation
- Use mermaid diagrams for any flow, architecture, or state transition:
  - sequenceDiagram for request flows
  - graph/flowchart for architecture
  - stateDiagram for state machines
  - classDiagram for OOP/LLD
  - gitGraph for branching strategies
- Use comparison tables (| Feature | Option A | Option B |) for decision-making
- Keep code blocks short and focused — max 20-30 lines per block

─────────────────────────────────────────────
3. CALLOUT BOXES (Mandatory — use ALL types where relevant)
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Scatter these THROUGHOUT the tutorial body, not just at the end:

a) SCENARIO BOX (purple) — Decision-making context
   <div class="callout-scenario">
   **Scenario**: [Real situation]. **Answer/Decision**: [What to pick and why].
   </div>

b) APPLYING THIS BOX (green) — Practical takeaway for real projects
   <div class="callout-tip">
   **Applying this** — [How to use this in your actual codebase/team/architecture].
   </div>

c) INTERVIEW READY BOX (red) — Inline interview tips within the tutorial body
   <div class="callout-interview">
   🎯 **Interview Ready** — "[Exact question]" → [Concise, confident answer].
   </div>

d) INFO BOX (blue) — Important notes, rules, or gotchas
   <div class="callout-info">
   [Important technical note or rule to remember].
   </div>

e) WARNING BOX (yellow) — Common mistakes or dangers
   <div class="callout-warn">
   [Warning about a common pitfall or anti-pattern].
   </div>

MINIMUM per tutorial:
- 2+ scenario boxes
- 2+ applying-this boxes
- 2+ inline interview-ready boxes (within the body)

─────────────────────────────────────────────
4. 🎯 INTERVIEW CORNER (Dedicated Section — MANDATORY)
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Place this as the LAST major section (before Quick Reference if one exists).

Format:
## 🎯 Interview Corner

Include 3-5 questions, each as a separate callout-interview div:

<div class="callout-interview">

**Q: "[Exact question as an interviewer would ask it]"**

[Answer: 4-6 sentences. Confident, structured, scenario-backed.
 Start with the direct answer, then explain WHY, then give a real example.
 End with a trade-off or nuance that shows depth.]

**Follow-up trap**: "[The gotcha follow-up]" → [How to handle it].

</div>

Question design rules:
- Phrase questions EXACTLY as interviewers ask them (not textbook style)
- Answers must be speakable — imagine saying this out loud in an interview
- Include at least 1 "design/architecture" question ("How would you design...")
- Include at least 1 "compare/contrast" question ("X vs Y, when would you...")
- Include at least 1 "debugging/production" question ("Your system is doing X, how do you fix...")
- Add "Follow-up trap" to at least 2 questions — the gotcha the interviewer throws next
- Answers should reference real technologies (Redis, Kafka, PostgreSQL, Spring, etc.)

─────────────────────────────────────────────
5. QUICK REFERENCE / CHEAT SHEET (Optional but recommended)
─────────────────────────────────────────────
- Summary table or code-style cheat sheet at the very end
- One-liner per concept — scannable in 30 seconds
- Use for revision before interviews

─────────────────────────────────────────────
6. CLOSING QUOTE
─────────────────────────────────────────────
- End with a > blockquote — one golden rule or key insight
- This should be the ONE thing someone remembers from the entire tutorial

─────────────────────────────────────────────
CONTENT RULES (Non-Negotiable)
─────────────────────────────────────────────
✅ DO:
- Use real-world scenarios (e-commerce, payment, social media, banking)
- Show code in Java (primary), with SQL/bash/config where relevant
- Explain trade-offs, not just "how" — always answer "when" and "why not"
- Make it simple enough for anyone to understand, yet detailed enough to impress
- Use ❌/✅ markers for wrong/right approaches
- Keep the tone conversational — "you", "your", "imagine", "think of it as"

❌ DON'T:
- Use textbook definitions as opening lines
- Use Foo/Bar/Baz in code examples
- Write walls of text without code, diagrams, or tables
- Add interview content that just restates the tutorial — it must add NEW depth
- Use generic answers like "it depends" without explaining WHAT it depends on
- Skip the "when NOT to use" — knowing when to avoid something is more valuable
```

### Callout Box Reference

| Callout | Class | Color | Use For |
|---------|-------|-------|---------|
| Scenario | `callout-scenario` | Purple | "You're building X. Here's the decision..." |
| Applying This | `callout-tip` | Green | "In your real project, do this..." |
| Interview Ready | `callout-interview` | Red | "🎯 Interview Ready" tips + Q&A |
| Info | `callout-info` | Blue | Important rules, key facts |
| Warning | `callout-warn` | Yellow | Common mistakes, anti-patterns |

HTML format (required — markdown classes don't work, must use raw HTML):

```html
<div class="callout-scenario">

**Scenario**: Your team is building a payment service that processes 10K TPS.
**Decision**: Use event-driven architecture with Kafka because...

</div>

<div class="callout-tip">

**Applying this** — In production, always set connection pool timeouts...

</div>

<div class="callout-interview">

**Q: "How would you handle distributed transactions across microservices?"**

I'd use the Saga pattern with orchestration because...

**Follow-up trap**: "What about 2PC?" → Avoid in microservices because...

</div>
```

> **Note**: There must be a blank line after the opening `<div>` tag and before the closing `</div>` tag for markdown to render inside the HTML block.

## 🎨 Theming

The app uses a **medical-grade eye-friendly** color palette:

| Property | Light Theme | Dark Theme |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| Background | `#f5f0eb` (warm off-white) | `#1a1b1e` (deep warm gray) |
| Paper | `#faf7f3` | `#242529` |
| Text Primary | `#2d2a26` | `#e0dcd5` |
| Accent | `#4a7c6f` (sage green) | `#7fbfae` (soft teal) |

**Why these colors?**
- No pure white (`#fff`) or pure black (`#000`) — reduces contrast glare
- Warm undertones reduce blue light emission
- Accent colors are in the green spectrum — easiest on the eyes
- Meets WCAG AA contrast ratios

## 🚢 Deploying to GitHub Pages

### Automatic (CI/CD)

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) that automatically builds and deploys on every push to `main`.

#### Setup Steps:

1. **Create a GitHub repository** named `tech-tutorial`

2. **Push your code:**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/tech-tutorial.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to your repo → **Settings** → **Pages**
   - Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
   - The workflow will trigger automatically on push

4. **Access your site:**
   ```
   https://<your-username>.github.io/tech-tutorial/
   ```

### How the Pipeline Works

The `deploy.yml` workflow does the following:

```
Push to main → Checkout code → Setup Node 20 → npm ci → npm run build → Upload dist/ → Deploy to Pages
```

| Step | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `actions/checkout@v4` | Clones your repo |
| `actions/setup-node@v4` | Installs Node.js 20 with npm cache |
| `npm ci` | Clean install of dependencies (faster than `npm install`) |
| `npm run build` | Runs `vite build`, outputs to `dist/` |
| `upload-pages-artifact@v3` | Packages `dist/` for GitHub Pages |
| `deploy-pages@v4` | Deploys the artifact to GitHub Pages |

The `404.html` in `public/` handles SPA routing — GitHub Pages serves it for any unknown path, and the script redirects to `index.html` preserving the route.

### Manual Deployment

If you prefer manual deployment:

```bash
npm run build
# Then upload the dist/ folder to any static hosting (Netlify, Vercel, S3, etc.)
```
