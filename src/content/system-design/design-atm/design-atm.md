# Design ATM System — The Vending Machine With Trust Issues

## The Vending Machine Analogy

An ATM is like a vending machine — but instead of snacks, it dispenses cash. And instead of trusting you with a coin, it needs to verify your identity, check your bank balance, ensure the cash drawer has enough money, record every transaction, and handle the case where the machine jams mid-dispensing. Oh, and it must do all this while being offline-resilient, tamper-proof, and available 24/7.

## 1. Requirements

### Functional
- Authenticate user via card + 4-digit PIN
- Check account balance
- Withdraw cash (with denomination selection)
- Deposit cash/checks
- Transfer between accounts
- Print mini-statement / receipt

### Non-Functional
- **Availability**: 99.99% — ATMs must work 24/7
- **Security**: Encrypted communication, tamper detection
- **Consistency**: Account balance must be accurate (no double-dispensing)
- **Offline resilience**: Handle temporary network failures gracefully
- **Concurrency**: One transaction per ATM at a time, but millions of ATMs globally

## 3. ATM State Machine — The Heart of the Design

Every ATM transaction follows a strict state machine:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Idle
    Idle --> CardInserted: Insert Card
    CardInserted --> PINEntry: Card Read OK
    CardInserted --> CardEjected: Card Read Failed
    PINEntry --> Authenticated: PIN Valid
    PINEntry --> PINRetry: PIN Invalid (attempt < 3)
    PINRetry --> PINEntry: Retry
    PINEntry --> CardRetained: 3 Failed Attempts
    Authenticated --> MenuSelection: Show Menu
    MenuSelection --> BalanceInquiry: Check Balance
    MenuSelection --> WithdrawalFlow: Withdraw
    MenuSelection --> DepositFlow: Deposit
    WithdrawalFlow --> Dispensing: Approved
    WithdrawalFlow --> Declined: Insufficient Funds
    Dispensing --> TransactionComplete: Cash Taken
    Dispensing --> CashRetracted: Cash Not Taken (30s timeout)
    TransactionComplete --> AnotherTransaction: Yes
    TransactionComplete --> CardEjected: No
    AnotherTransaction --> MenuSelection
    CardEjected --> [*]
    CardRetained --> [*]
    Declined --> MenuSelection
```

<div class="callout-info">

**Key insight**: The state machine ensures the ATM can NEVER be in an ambiguous state. Every possible scenario (timeout, failure, user abandonment) has a defined transition. This is critical for financial systems.

## 4. The Withdrawal Flow — Where It Gets Tricky

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant ATM
    participant Gateway as ATM Gateway
    participant TxnSvc as Transaction Service
    participant DB as Core Banking DB
    participant Dispenser as Cash Dispenser

    User->>ATM: Withdraw ₹5,000
    ATM->>Gateway: POST /withdraw {card, amount, atm_id}
    Gateway->>TxnSvc: Create transaction (PENDING)
    TxnSvc->>DB: BEGIN TRANSACTION
    TxnSvc->>DB: SELECT balance WHERE account_id = X FOR UPDATE
    Note over DB: Row locked — no other ATM can modify
    alt Balance >= 5000
        TxnSvc->>DB: UPDATE balance = balance - 5000
        TxnSvc->>DB: INSERT INTO transactions (DEBIT, 5000, PENDING)
        TxnSvc->>DB: COMMIT
        TxnSvc->>Gateway: APPROVED
        Gateway->>ATM: Dispense ₹5,000
        ATM->>Dispenser: Dispense cash
        alt Cash dispensed successfully
            Dispenser->>ATM: SUCCESS
            ATM->>Gateway: Dispensing confirmed
            Gateway->>TxnSvc: Mark transaction COMPLETED
        else Dispenser jammed
            Dispenser->>ATM: FAILURE
            ATM->>Gateway: Dispensing failed
            Gateway->>TxnSvc: REVERSE transaction
            TxnSvc->>DB: UPDATE balance = balance + 5000
            TxnSvc->>DB: INSERT reversal record
            ATM->>User: "Transaction failed. Amount not deducted."
        end
    else Insufficient balance
        TxnSvc->>DB: ROLLBACK
        TxnSvc->>Gateway: DECLINED
        Gateway->>ATM: Show "Insufficient funds"
    end
```

<div class="callout-warn">

**Warning**: The most dangerous scenario is: money deducted from account BUT cash not dispensed. This is why the transaction is marked PENDING until the dispenser confirms. If dispensing fails, an automatic reversal kicks in. If the ATM crashes mid-dispensing, a reconciliation job detects PENDING transactions older than 5 minutes and reverses them.

</div>

---

## 5. Handling the "Money Deducted But Not Received" Problem

This is the #1 customer complaint. Here's how to handle it:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    A[Transaction marked PENDING] --> B{Cash dispensed?}
    B -->|Yes, user took it| C[Mark COMPLETED]
    B -->|Yes, user didn't take it in 30s| D[Retract cash, mark REVERSED]
    B -->|No, dispenser jammed| E[Mark FAILED, auto-reverse]
    B -->|Unknown, ATM crashed| F[Reconciliation Job]
    F --> G{PENDING > 5 min?}
    G -->|Yes| H[Auto-reverse + alert ops team]
    G -->|No| I[Wait for ATM to reconnect]
```

<div class="callout-scenario">

**Scenario**: User withdraws ₹10,000. Bank deducts the amount. ATM dispenser jams after dispensing only ₹5,000. **Decision**: The ATM detects partial dispensing via cash counter sensors. It reports to the gateway: "Dispensed ₹5,000 of ₹10,000." The transaction service reverses ₹5,000 and marks the transaction as PARTIAL. The user gets ₹5,000 cash + ₹5,000 reversed to account. An alert is raised for the ops team to refill/fix the dispenser.

</div>

## 6. Class Design (LLD)

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class ATM {
        -String atmId
        -String location
        -ATMState currentState
        -CashDispenser dispenser
        -CardReader cardReader
        +authenticateUser(card, pin)
        +processWithdrawal(amount)
        +checkBalance()
        +ejectCard()
    }

    class CashDispenser {
        -Map~Denomination, Integer~ cashInventory
        +dispenseCash(amount) boolean
        +canDispense(amount) boolean
        +getAvailableDenominations() List
    }

    class CardReader {
        +readCard() CardInfo
        +ejectCard()
        +retainCard()
    }

    class Transaction {
        -String txnId
        -String accountId
        -TransactionType type
        -BigDecimal amount
        -TransactionStatus status
        -LocalDateTime timestamp
    }

    class Account {
        -String accountId
        -BigDecimal balance
        -String pin
        +debit(amount) boolean
        +credit(amount) boolean
        +getBalance() BigDecimal
    }

    ATM --> CashDispenser
    ATM --> CardReader
    ATM --> Transaction
    Transaction --> Account
```

### Cash Dispensing Algorithm

```java
// Greedy algorithm — use largest denominations first
public Map<Integer, Integer> calculateDenominations(int amount) {
    int[] denominations = {2000, 500, 200, 100};
    Map<Integer, Integer> result = new LinkedHashMap<>();

    for (int denom : denominations) {
        int available = cashInventory.getOrDefault(denom, 0);
        int needed = amount / denom;
        int used = Math.min(needed, available);

        if (used > 0) {
            result.put(denom, used);
            amount -= used * denom;
        }
    }

    if (amount > 0) {
        throw new InsufficientCashException("ATM cannot dispense exact amount");
    }
    return result;
}
```

<div class="callout-interview">

🎯 **Interview Ready** — "What if the ATM has ₹500 notes but the user wants ₹300?" → The ATM should check if it CAN dispense the exact amount before deducting from the account. If the smallest denomination is ₹500 and the user wants ₹300, show "Amount must be a multiple of ₹500" BEFORE processing. Never deduct first and figure out dispensing later.

</div>

## 7. Security Considerations

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|-----------|
| PIN interception | End-to-end encryption (ATM to bank), PIN block encryption using 3DES/AES |
| Card skimming | EMV chip cards (not magnetic stripe), jitter on card reader |
| Physical tampering | Tamper sensors, ink-staining cash on forced entry |
| Replay attacks | Unique transaction ID + timestamp + nonce for every request |
| Man-in-the-middle | TLS 1.3 with certificate pinning |
| Brute force PIN | Lock card after 3 failed attempts, retain card |

<div class="callout-tip">

**Applying this** — In your design, always mention that the PIN is NEVER stored or transmitted in plain text. It's encrypted at the keypad hardware level using a Hardware Security Module (HSM). The bank only receives an encrypted PIN block and validates it against the stored hash.

</div>

---

## 🎯 Interview Corner

<div class="callout-interview">

**Q: "What happens during a transaction timeout — money deducted but ATM didn't get the response?"**

The ATM sends the withdrawal request and starts a timer (say 30 seconds). If no response arrives, the ATM shows "Transaction could not be completed" and ejects the card WITHOUT dispensing cash. On the bank side, the transaction is in PENDING state. A reconciliation service runs every 5 minutes — it finds PENDING transactions where the ATM never confirmed dispensing, and auto-reverses them. The customer sees the amount credited back within 5-30 minutes. For immediate resolution, the customer can call the bank and the support team can see the PENDING status and trigger manual reversal.

**Follow-up trap**: "What if the response was sent but the ATM's network dropped before receiving it?" → This is why the bank marks it PENDING, not COMPLETED. The ATM must explicitly confirm "cash dispensed" for the transaction to be marked COMPLETED. No confirmation = auto-reversal.

</div>

<div class="callout-interview">

**Q: "How do you handle concurrent withdrawals from the same account at two different ATMs?"**

Database-level row locking. When ATM-1 initiates a withdrawal, the transaction service does `SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE id = X FOR UPDATE`. This acquires an exclusive lock on that row. If ATM-2 tries to withdraw simultaneously, its query blocks until ATM-1's transaction commits or rolls back. This ensures the balance check and deduction are atomic. At scale, I'd use optimistic locking with version numbers — `UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 5000, version = version + 1 WHERE id = X AND version = 42`. If the version doesn't match, retry.

</div>

<div class="callout-interview">

**Q: "How would you design the ATM to work during network outages?"**

Offline mode with limits. The ATM stores a local cache of recently authenticated cards with their encrypted PINs and a pre-approved offline withdrawal limit (e.g., ₹5,000). During network outage, the ATM authenticates locally, allows withdrawals up to the offline limit, and queues transactions locally. When network restores, it syncs all queued transactions with the bank. The risk is that the account might be overdrawn if the user withdrew at multiple offline ATMs. Banks accept this risk for small amounts and reconcile later. The offline limit is configurable per card/account.

</div>

## Quick Reference

| Concept | One-Liner |
|---------|-----------|
| State Machine | Every ATM interaction follows defined states and transitions |
| PENDING Transaction | Deducted but not yet confirmed dispensed — auto-reverses if unconfirmed |
| FOR UPDATE | SQL row lock to prevent concurrent modifications |
| HSM | Hardware Security Module — encrypts PIN at hardware level |
| Reconciliation | Background job that detects and fixes stuck transactions |
| Denomination Algorithm | Greedy approach — largest notes first |
| Offline Mode | Limited transactions cached locally during network outage |
| Card Retention | Card kept by ATM after 3 failed PIN attempts |
